Computer science is a highly demanded major of this generation. This was an unignorably big part of the reason why I chose to learn computer science and it was not enough motivation for me to learn about this specific field. Planning for the future is not quite my style of getting things done. In terms of efficiency, my planless lifestyle is not the best way to get things done. RadGrad is helpful planning for the future in that sense. RadGrad gave me a clear view of what courses and opportunities are provided for the computer science major.

RadGrad gave choices of interests related to computer science. Courses provided by UH Manoa were labeled with the contents and interests, so it was easy to plan on what courses to take in the future. Seeing those interests, I’ve learned that computer science covers wider fields of studies than I thought. Many of them were never heard of words. For example, “Cryptography is the study of techniques for secure communication.” I have never heard of it and it sounds interesting. RadGrad taught me that computer science has various areas of studies.

Out of various computer science related interests, IOS, Android, computer graphics, and game design interesting are some of my interests. Smart phones are essential to live in a modern world. It has been at that position for a while now but app developing still sounds like a skill with a big potential. Smart phones have replaced many things including mp3 player, radio, note etc. Soon it might replace computers as well. I could find many opportunities that provide app development and mobile computing on RadGrad which can help me learn them.
 
I find RadGrad as a window of opportunity. I have learned so much more possibilities of computer science. It helped to find the pathway to be a computer science major that I wish to be. I have figured out my interests and found corresponding courses to take. I am motivated to take opportunities to learn deeper about my interests.
